    const prompt = `You are helping with a LinkedIn posting routine. 
Your job is to use your Google Search capabilities to find 3 recent, highly relevant news articles. You must find exactly ONE article for EACH of the following 3 domains:

Domain 1: ${LANES[0].name} (Focus areas: ${LANES[0].queries.join(', ')})
Domain 2: ${LANES[1].name} (Focus areas: ${LANES[1].queries.join(', ')})
Domain 3: ${LANES[2].name} (Focus areas: ${LANES[2].queries.join(', ')})

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use any of these recently used URLs:
${avoidUrls.join('\n')}

Once you have found 3 excellent articles across these domains, draft a LinkedIn post for each one in Joseph's voice.

VOICE GUIDELINES FOR JOSEPH
- Core principle: Direct, evidence-oriented, and sharply analytical. No fake warmth or corporate fluff.
- Structure & Depth: Start with a strong, definitive hook. Provide 1-2 key insights or data points from the article. Conclude with a clear takeaway or slightly contrarian perspective.
- Length: Do not make it too short or flat. A solid 4-7 sentences that flow well, perhaps broken up for readability, is ideal. We want depth and engagement, not just a passing comment.
- Tone: Confident, professional, and highly insightful. Write as if you've just realized a profound, contrarian, or highly valuable insight about the market or technology. Frame the post around this 'aha!' moment or deep industry realization to drive high engagement.
- Evidence before tone: Specific numbers and findings over polished vagueness.
- Banned words: passionate, leverage, utilize, robust, synergy, seamless, empower, journey, landscape, thrilled, amazing, game-changer, transform, thought leadership, perfect fit, excited to apply, fast-paced environment, dynamic team, proven track record.
- Banned patterns: Abstract bragging, fake optimism, vague professionalism, openers that warm up.

CRITICAL RULES FOR THE URL AND FACTS:
1. You MUST use real, recent news articles you found via Google Search.
2. Do NOT hallucinate, guess, or invent the "url". It MUST be the exact, valid, clickable link copy-pasted directly from your search results.
3. If an article mentions a report (like a 2024 or 2025 report), do not hallucinate a future year (e.g., 2026) just because the current year is 2026. Stick strictly to the facts in the article.

Return a JSON array of 3 objects with the following schema. Return ONLY the raw JSON array starting with '[' and ending with ']'. Do NOT wrap it in markdown code blocks (\`\`\`json).
[
  {
    "title": "A short theme or title for the option",
    "postText": "The exact post text",
    "url": "The EXACT, real url of the article directly from your search results"
  }
]`;
